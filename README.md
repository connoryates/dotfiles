# Dotfiles

Keeping track of my dotfiles

## terraform

Run `brew bundle install` and `./install-hooks-global.sh` to install useful terraform pre-commit hooks.

Edit `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to add/remove any hooks and then copy it to your repo root

See https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform for more info
